Abstract: 
This paper proposes a new theory of category membership—Foil Theory—which redefines the role of similarity in the theory of universals by inverting the traditional relationship between paradigm and non-paradigm (foil). By replacing internal similarity-based definitions with external, foil-based boundary conditions, the theory offers a parsimonious and semantically coherent alternative grounded in the logic of negation. Drawing on classical and contemporary work in logic, semantics, and epistemic set theory, the paper outlines the conceptual foundations, logical implications, and philosophical significance of this approach.

The theory of forms [Plato 2000; Fine 1993] developed into the more general problem of universals [Aristotle 1999; Abelard 1997; Boethius 1999; Aquinas 1989].

The most recent iterative solutions [resemblance / tropes / prototypes / exemplars] all rely, in various degrees, on the notion of similarity.

One version of this holds that b [a member of P] is more similar to a [the paradigm of P] than c [the foil — a non-member of P, i.e., a member of Q or U, where Q is a contrasting class or U is the complement of P] [Nicod 1928; Carnap 1950a].

However, this permits virtually anything to be similar to anything else [Goodman 1951, 1972].

Still, it is often claimed this is the best we can do [Quine 1969].

We propose a novel solution: invert the relation between paradigm and foil such that P is defined not by similarity to the paradigm but by contrast with the foil.
This inversion removes the necessity of appealing to internal similarity.

We begin by assuming not-P — that is, we examine the space Q or U (the contrast class or the complement of P).

Here we invoke the Raven Paradox [Hempel 1955], which shows — via contraposition of the material conditional — that any confirming instance of the negation contributes evidence toward the positive hypothesis.

Accordingly, every observed foil (not-P) can serve as indirect confirmation of P.

Next, we apply double negation to obtain not-not-P.

However, we do not treat this as a logical identity with P, but rather define not-not-P as P₁ — a derivative or successor to the original concept P₀.

The transition from P₀ to P₁ may be formalized via the axiom of succession [Lagrange 1797] and the principle of induction [Peano 1889], allowing a construction where P₁ captures the emergent structure defined by exclusion from Q or U.

This interpretation of double negation is neither classical, intuitionist, nor constructivist.

Yet it finds support in formalism [Hilbert 1900], the principle of tolerance [Carnap 1936], the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets [Leinster 2014a, 2014b], and parsimony [Kneale and Kneale 1962].

We now introduce an explication of P₁ [Carnap 1950b]: P₁ specifies the boundary conditions for membership in P₀.

Thus, P is no longer defined by internal resemblance to a paradigm but by external constraints imposed by the structure of Q or U.

The set P emerges as a response to its foil.

Therefore, we eliminate the need for similarity-based classification by defining P via its negation space.
