A. Developmental & Cognitive Evidence
Infants: object segregation, novelty detection, statistical learning.
Early categories require perceptual boundaries.
1. Infancy & Early Childhood Research
1.1. Perceptual Categorization in Infants
Research by Quinn (1987, 1999), Eimas (1994), and Rosenkrantz (1974) collectively shows that infants can form broad, basic-level categories early in development. Quinn’s work demonstrates early visual category formation; Eimas highlights auditory categorical sensitivity; Rosenkrantz evidences shape-based perceptual differentiation. This foundational capacity for boundary detection as a primitive operation aligns with cognitive neuroscientific findings on early parsing mechanisms (Zacks et al., 2007; Ezzyat & Davachi, 2011; Chen et al., 2017) [Annotation: A.1.1.1; #1.1].
Quinn, Eimas, Rosenkrantz work on basic-level categories shows infants can form broad categories early on.

2. AI and Computational Models
2.1. Image/object boundary detection as a precursor to semantic understanding: In computer vision, boundary detection (e.g., edge detection) is a necessary first step for object recognition and higher-level semantic interpretation. Algorithms first identify edges or boundaries, then group regions, and finally map these to object categories or concepts. This mirrors the dependency chain in your framework: concept formation cannot occur without prior differentiation of boundaries.
2.2. Formal concept analysis and boundary representations: In formal concept analysis and CAD modeling, boundary representations (BREPs) define primitive shapes and their relations, enabling the identification and classification of objects. The ontological structure of these systems begins with boundary delineation before any higher-level reasoning about object identity or category can occur

1. Cognitive and Neuroscientific Evidence 
1.1. Boundary detection as a primitive operation:
Research shows that both spatial navigation and episodic memory rely on the segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events, with boundary detection acting as the mechanism that enables this segmentation. Peaks in hippocampal activity at event boundaries are linked to the binding of preceding information into cohesive episodes, supporting the idea that boundary detection temporally precedes concept formation

1.2.

1.3. Novelty/change detection as boundary detection: The neurological basis for novelty detection—identifying when "something changes"—is closely tied to boundary detection mechanisms. The hippocampus and associated cortical networks are implicated in detecting both spatial and event boundaries, which then enable the formation of new memory traces and concepts

Mountcastle (1978, 1998) showed cortical columns code for differences and transitions rather than absolute features, emphasizing boundary sensitivity.
Gibson’s ecological approach (1966, 1979) argued that perceptual systems evolved primarily to extract invariants and ecological boundaries, rather than internal similarities.
James J. Gibson (1979) further emphasized boundary detection as central to perceiving affordances.
Marr (1982) theorized edge detection as a necessary precursor for object recognition in computational vision.
LeCun et al. (2015) demonstrated that in modern deep learning systems, explicit segmentation (boundary detection) is critical for reliable object classification.

Marr (1982) already cited but should be highlighted in the gap analysis as the foundational computational framework that still lacks full integration with developmental and philosophical accounts.
3.1. Literature gap: While boundary detection is well-studied in perception and AI, few works explicitly frame it as the primitive operation for all concept formation systems across domains. There is a need for a cross-disciplinary taxonomy distinguishing systems that treat boundary detection as explicit, implicit, or absent, and analyzing the consequences for concept formation. 








































H Hierarchy 

There are many theories of concept formation; however, most focus on mature or late-stage concept use. Regarding early concept formation there are fewer.  

you do not need to justify each level in exhaustive detail. You need to justify the framework’s coherence and utility.

💡 Why you do need some justification
1️⃣ Scholarly legitimacy
    • You are proposing a new or synthesized hierarchical framework (12 levels).
    • Readers (and reviewers) will expect a rationale: why these levels? Why not 7, 10, or 15?
2️⃣ Comparative context
    • Existing frameworks (e.g., Piaget's developmental stages, Marr’s vision stages, hierarchical predictive coding, levels of analysis in cognitive science) all justify why they have certain stages.
    • Yours must be situated relative to these.

💬 How much justification?
You do not need
    • A separate section explaining every level in detail.
    • Exhaustive empirical evidence for each level individually.
You do need
    • A short, conceptual justification paragraph or two, explaining:
        ◦ The principle behind splitting levels (e.g., each level introduces a new kind of parsing or abstraction).
        ◦ How each level builds on the previous one.
        ◦ Why this helps clarify the progression from biological to cognitive to symbolic.

✅ Example of short justification text
We propose a 12-level hierarchy to integrate biological, perceptual, and conceptual boundaries in a unified framework. Each level introduces a qualitatively distinct parsing operation — from basic metabolic or reflex boundaries (levels 1–4), through perceptual and temporal segmentation (levels 5–6), to proto-conceptual grouping and abstract symbolic reasoning (levels 7–12). This progression mirrors both evolutionary and developmental trajectories and aligns with evidence from neuroscience (e.g., columnar organization, figure-ground separation), infant studies (e.g., object permanence), and artificial systems (e.g., feature hierarchies in CNNs). While the precise number of levels is not claimed to be final, this layered structure serves as a scaffold to situate current findings and highlight the critical role of mid-level parsing operations.

💡 Key strategy
    • Emphasize pragmatic justification rather than dogmatic:
"The exact number of levels is less important than the conceptual clarity they provide."
    • Compare briefly to well-known stage-based models (Piaget, Marr, etc.) to establish legitimacy.

Yes! This is already very strong — and nearly sufficient as a "justification summary" for your 12-level hierarchy.
Let’s clarify why it works and add a couple of small suggestions to make it even sharper.

💡 Why your text is sufficient
    • ✅ You cite foundational works at each level, so you're not inventing levels from nowhere.
    • ✅ You show how each level progressively builds more complex parsing (from self-maintenance to object individuation to full concepts).
    • ✅ You explicitly note there is no existing full integrated hierarchy, which justifies proposing your own.
    • ✅ You identify gaps and position your work as the integrative step.

✅ Minor refinements to make it even clearer and more publish-ready
Here’s a slightly polished version, with no big changes to your structure, but adding clarifying transitions and explicit references to "parsing" and "boundary detection":

✍️ Refined version
Levels 1–3 (Boundary creation, metabolism, homeostasis)
    • Maturana & Varela — Autopoiesis and Cognition (1980): Emphasize self-production and self-maintenance, defining the cell membrane as the fundamental self/non-self boundary.
    • Erwin Schrödinger — What is Life? (1944): Frames life as maintaining internal order (negentropy), intrinsically dependent on metabolic boundaries and homeostatic parsing.

Level 4 (Irritability / reactivity)
    • Claude Bernard (19th c.): Concept of "milieu intérieur" — the internal environment requiring stable boundaries.
    • Sherrington — The Integrative Action of the Nervous System (1906): Reflex arcs as early examples of environmental parsing and reactivity.

Levels 5–7 (Valence, threat detection, fight-or-flight)
    • Joseph LeDoux — The Emotional Brain (1996): Threat circuits in the amygdala illustrate parsing valence (good/bad) and fast danger detection.
    • Antonio Damasio — Descartes' Error (1994): Somatic marker hypothesis shows bodily state parsing for rapid value judgments.

Levels 8–9 (Perceptual parsing, figure-ground separation)
    • David Marr — Vision (1982): "Primal sketch" emphasizes edge and boundary extraction as the first step of object perception.
    • Gestalt psychology (Koffka, Wertheimer): Principles of grouping rely on pre-attentive boundary detection.
    • Hubel & Wiesel (1960s): Neuronal edge detectors in early visual cortex as biological evidence for low-level parsing.

Levels 10–12 (Concepts and higher cognition)
    • Jerry Fodor — Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong (1998): Mental representations depend on individuation boundaries.
    • Ruth Millikan, Tyler Burge: Natural kinds and conceptual content presuppose stable object parsing.
    • Gareth Evans (1982): Demonstrative reference and object individuation further highlight cognitive parsing.

🔬 No integrated hierarchy yet
While these works capture critical stages, no author has explicitly unified them into a continuous biological-to-cognitive parsing hierarchy with recursive boundary detection as its backbone.

🟢 Opportunity for this work
We propose to explicitly connect these levels under one overarching principle:
Boundary parsing is the fundamental constraint and enabler at every level of life and cognition, from metabolic self-maintenance to abstract concept formation.

📄 Closest partial integrative works
    • Maturana & Varela (1980): Strong on low-level autopoiesis but do not extend fully to higher cognition.
    • Evan Thompson — Mind in Life (2007): Connects autopoiesis to enactive cognition but stops short of a fully sequenced hierarchy.
    • Jakob von Uexküll: Early vision of animal Umwelt as boundary-driven but not formally layered.

✅ Conclusion
This refined paragraph-level justification is enough to:
    • Convince reviewers and readers your levels are grounded in existing research.
    • Clearly motivate why a unified hierarchical model is needed.
    • Prepare the reader to accept your focus on levels 4–6 without challenging the rest.



How the hierarchical framework connects to the literature review
🟢 Why use the hierarchy?
    • It shows how boundary detection recurs and scaffolds each layer of concept development.
    • It unifies evidence from biology, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and AI.
    • It makes explicit which levels are supported by which bodies of literature, and where gaps lie.

✅ Hierarchical framing inside your lit review
1️⃣ Levels 1–4: Physiological and primitive perceptual boundaries
    • Sources: Hubel & Wiesel (1960s), Mountcastle, basic reflex research.
    • Focus: Physical edge and contact parsing → foundational for life and simple avoidance behavior.
    • Boundary function: Self–non-self distinction; no cognition yet.

2️⃣ Levels 5–7: Perceptual parsing and object individuation
    • Sources: Treisman’s Feature Integration Theory (1980), Kahneman et al. (1992), Marr’s vision theory.
    • Focus: Figure-ground separation, perceptual edges, object tracking (object files).
    • Boundary function: Early environmental segmentation → precondition for object permanence.

3️⃣ Level 8: Proto-concepts (object files to simple categories)
    • Sources: Piaget (object permanence → proto-categories ~9–18 months), Baillargeon studies on infants, animal concept formation experiments.
    • Focus: Start of category-like groupings ("dog", "ball") but not yet symbolic.
    • Boundary function: Stabilized object parsing becomes category skeletons.

4️⃣ Levels 9–10: Contextual and abstract concept learning
    • Sources: Prototype theory (Rosch, 1970s), Exemplar theory, Theory-theory, some animal generalization studies.
    • Focus: Learning context-sensitive and generalizable categories.
    • Boundary function: Boundaries in more abstract feature space, start of abstraction beyond immediate perception.

5️⃣ Levels 11–12: Symbolic concepts and meta-cognition
    • Sources: Vygotsky (cultural mediation, symbolic thought), higher-level rule-based learning, Kahneman System 2.
    • Focus: Language, formal categories, self-reflective concepts.
    • Boundary function: Symbolic or linguistic boundaries (definitions, logical classes), reflective self-other parsing.

💡 Summary framing inside your lit review
At each hierarchical level, you can explicitly cite:
    • Which authors or experiments empirically support that level’s parsing/boundary process
    • Which theoretical accounts depend on (or skip) that parsing step

⭐ Benefits
✅ Makes your review structured and layered, not just a list of theories.
✅ Highlights exactly where your "boundary-first" thesis fits — across levels.
✅ Identifies underexplored gaps (e.g., temporal parsing, higher-level self-boundaries).
✅ Supports your philosophical and computational claims together.

✅ Concrete example: opening paragraph of lit review with hierarchy
Most accounts of concept formation presuppose that objects or features have already been separated from the perceptual stream. Yet across biology and cognition, from basic metabolic distinctions (levels 1–4) to perceptual object files (levels 5–8) and finally to symbolic reasoning (levels 9–12), each stage depends on increasingly complex forms of boundary parsing. By aligning classical and modern theories with this hierarchy, we clarify where current models succeed, where they implicitly rely on lower-level parsing, and where critical gaps remain.
