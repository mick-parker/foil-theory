Integrated Minimal-Axiomatic & Empirically Grounded Parsing/Foil Theory Framework
ðŸ’¡ Axiomatic Framework for Parsing as Foundational
ðŸŸ¢ Axiom 1: Continuity of Sensory Input

    Statement:
    All raw sensory input SS is initially continuous and undifferentiated; there are no intrinsic boundaries or discrete objects.

    Interpretation:
    Mirrors raw signal streams (e.g., retinal image, sound waveform) â€” no inherent pre-structured segmentation.

    Empirical Link:
    Early visual processing shows no object segmentation at the sensory receptor level; signal continuity is well-established.

ðŸ”µ Axiom 2: Field-Like Salience Gradients

    Statement:
    Within SS, local "salience gradients" GG arise as field-like forces driven by contrasts (brightness, movement, novelty), inducing local attractor regions ("patches").

    Interpretation:
    Gradients are continuous, not discrete â€” reflecting relative change, analogous to physical fields like gravity or magnetism.

    Minimal Formalization (FOL style):
    âˆ€x (if x is a local salience maximum â†’ x forms a patch).

    Computational Modeling Suggestion:
    Use simple edge detection (e.g., Sobel filter) on images as a proxy for salience gradient detection.

    Empirical Support:
    Neural receptive fields (Hubel & Wiesel), visual edge detection, and infant sensitivity to boundaries support this gradient emergence.

ðŸŸ  Axiom 3: Objects as Temporary Configurations

    Statement:
    Objects OO are temporary, probabilistic configurations of attractor patches; emergent within GG, not fixed substances.

    Interpretation:
    Explains perceptual plasticityâ€”objects can appear, dissolve, or drift (e.g., illusions, ambiguous figures).

    Empirical Link:
    Cognitive and developmental psychology show object representations are dynamic and context-dependent.

ðŸ”´ Axiom 4: Boundaries as Maximal Gradients

    Statement:
    The perceived boundary BB of an object corresponds to loci of maximal local rate of change in GG.

    Interpretation:
    Boundaries are relational and emerge from contrast, not from inherent object essences.

    Minimal Formalization:
    âˆ€p,q (if patches p and q co-occur consistently â†’ they form a stable cluster).

    Empirical Support:
    Matches edge detection theory and psychophysical boundary perception results.

ðŸ’¥ Derived Results (Sketch)

    Result 1: Perceptual Individuation
    Attractor patches are quasi-stable islands within GG, naturally individuating objects without assuming intrinsic "object-ness."

    Result 2: Concept Drift & Plasticity
    Objectsâ€™ configurations drift with changes in GG, driven by attention, experience, or context.

    Result 3: Cultural and Developmental Variability
    Priors and learning modulate GG, shaping perceptual parsing differently across individuals and cultures.

    Result 4: Connection to Similarity/Foil Theories
    Boundaries define "not P" (foils); similarity arises as a secondary refinement after parsing.

ðŸ§¾ Proof Sketch (Narrative Logic)

    Continuity Assumption: Sensory input is initially continuous (Axiom 1).

    Emergence of Gradients: Local contrasts generate salience gradients within this continuous field (Axiom 2).

    Boundary Formation: Boundaries are found at maximal local gradient changes, forming proto-objects (Axiom 4).

    Attractor Patches: Boundaries allow attractor patches to emergeâ€”local clusters of salience.

    Individuation: These patches correspond to perceptually individuated objects, contingent and transient.

    Dynamic Configurations: Changes in attention or experience shift these patches, explaining concept drift.

    Foil Logic & Similarity: Boundaries create natural foil regions; similarity measures follow only after parsing.
