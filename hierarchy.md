Cognitive hierarchy (stages) Biological‚Äìboundary parsing levels
1Ô∏è‚É£ Biophysical level Boundary creation: lipid bilayers form a physical "self/non-self" barrier.
Without this, there is no "self" to maintain or react. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic metabolic survival (e.g., cellular self-maintenance) Maturana & Varela Erwin Schr√∂dinger Prenatal, immediate postnatal 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Metabolic maintenance Detecting internal "damage" vs "healthy" ‚Äî chemical boundary parsing.
Repair mechanisms depend on distinguishing normal from abnormal internal states. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Irritability / basic sensitivity (basic stimulus-response) Maturana & Varela Erwin Schr√∂dinger Prenatal (late) ‚Üí newborn 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Homeostasis Continuous "boundary" between acceptable internal ranges and dangerous deviations. Feedback systems define what is inside tolerance and what is out. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflexes and automatic responses Discrimination Learning (Behaviorist Tradition), 3-5 Maturana & Varela Erwin Schr√∂dinger Newborn ‚Üí 1 month 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Irritability / reactivity Parse "touch" vs "no touch", "light" vs "dark" ‚Äî environmental boundaries. Reacting implies distinguishing event onset and offset. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Primitive sensorimotor integration (basic perceptual grouping) Animal Studies on Concept Formation, 4-7 / Piaget‚Äôs Developmental Theory, 4-9 Sense impression belongs just before or at the transition point between: Level 4: Irritability / basic reactivity (primitive responsiveness) thought experiment Claude Bernard Sherrington mountcastle gibson ~1 month ‚Üí 4 months 

5Ô∏è‚É£ Valence assignment Parsing stimuli as "good" vs "bad" ‚Äî a conceptual boundary.
First emergence of value-laden parsing. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Perceptual boundary parsing (detecting separations: figure/ground, edges) Connectionist Models (Neural Networks), 5-9 Dynamic Systems / Embodied Theories 5‚Äì1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ (broadest span) Sense impression belongs just before or at the transition point between: Level 5: Valence assignment (good/bad parsing) thought experiment Joseph LeDoux Antonio Damasio mountcastle gibson Kahneman (2011) 1 ~2 months ‚Üí 6 months 

6Ô∏è‚É£ Threat detection Spatial parsing: safe zones vs danger zones. Temporal parsing: when to act and when to stay still. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Temporal parsing / event segmentation Sense impression belongs just before or at the transition point between: And it is the raw substrate for Level 6 and above. thought experiment Joseph LeDoux Antonio Damasio mountcastle gibson Kahneman (2011) 1 ~3 months ‚Üí 8 months 

7Ô∏è‚É£ Fight-or-flight Parsing self-states: "I am under attack" vs "I am safe." Body mobilizes based on rapid categorical parsing.  7Ô∏è‚É£ Basic object permanence & tracking thought experiment 7-9 Joseph LeDoux Antonio Damasio mountcastle gibson Kahneman, Treisman & Gibbs Kahneman (2011) 1 ~6 months ‚Üí 12 months
