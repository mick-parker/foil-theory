‚úÖ Part 1: Four outlines (one for each option)
üåü Option 4: Multi-level structure (most accessible)
Outline

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

    Problem: Continuous sensory input needs division and meaning.

    Motivation: Parsing is the first act, foundational for all cognition.

    Preview: From empirical levels to metaphysical levels.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Lower-level (Empirical Core)

    Section 3: Boundary Detection as Parsing

    Section 4: Individuation via Parsing

    Section 8: Concepts as Foils

    Section 9: Dynamic Scrapbook

3Ô∏è‚É£ Middle-level (Bridging)

    Section 2: Foil Theory

    Section 5: FCI Variant Cluster

    Section 7: Similarity as Automata

    Section 12: Conceptual Economy

4Ô∏è‚É£ Upper-level (Metaphysical/Philosophical)

    Section 1: Scrapbook Epistemology

    Section 6: Universals vs Individuation

    Section 10: Universals by Parsing

    Section 11: Formalising Foils

    Section 13: Concept Formation by Parsing & Foils

5Ô∏è‚É£ Axioms and Additional Elements

    Present axioms as foundational "glue" throughout.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

    Unified view: parsing as ground for concepts, categories, knowledge, and universals.

üí° Option 2: Conceptual proof with axioms
Outline

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

    Problem framing

    Key intuition: parsing as the first conceptual operation.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Axiomatic foundation

    State axioms clearly (parsing necessity, contrast, dynamic update, etc.)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Conceptual proof sketch

    Stepwise explanation using axioms.

    Show how parsing leads to individuation, then concepts, then higher structures.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Supporting elements

    Thought experiments

    Heatmaps as conceptual illustrations

5Ô∏è‚É£ Implications

    Epistemology, philosophy of mind, AI, cognitive science.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

    Parsing as minimal yet sufficient foundation.

üß† Option 3: Philosophical argument (FOL style)
Outline

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

    Historical context: from sense data debates to modern parsing.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Premises

    Explicit formal premises (e.g., P1, P2...)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Inference rules

    List of logical steps from premises to sub-conclusions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusions

    Final high-level philosophical conclusions.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion

    Objections, possible counterarguments, relevance to universals and individuation.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

    Summarize logical necessity and philosophical impact.

üß¨ Option 1: Formal axiomatic proof
Outline

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

    Motivation for formal treatment.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Definitions

    Objects, fields, patches, foils, parsing function, etc.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Axioms

    Fully formal statements.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Proof tree

    Step-by-step derivation.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Proof sketch (as second presentation)

    More intuitive companion narrative.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Corollaries

    Concept formation

    Universals

    Cognitive economy

7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

    Mathematical minimality, explanatory power.
